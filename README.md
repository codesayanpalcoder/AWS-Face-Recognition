# AWS Face Recognition Project

The project walks through the steps of building a face recognition system using 'AWS Rekognition' service. It also talks about integration of this AWS service with various others such as AWS EC2, S3 and VPC. This project also demonstrates the integration of AWS services with a telegram bot to make it available for the end users to upload images and identify the faces.
